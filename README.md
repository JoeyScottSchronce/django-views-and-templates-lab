# Views and templates
In this lab, I've learned to create views and templates, use views to update objects and redirect users to other pages, and use CSS to stylize my templates.

## Learning Objectives
* Create function-based views to handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses
* Create templates for rendering HTML pages
